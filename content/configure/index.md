# Post-Installation Configuration

So you've installed, booted and logged into Arch Linux, now what? Let's assess the current state of our install: It only has a terminal login and a `root` account. The next steps are to:

* [Create a non-`root` user account and set up `sudo`.](users.md)
* [Install a GUI environment like a desktop environment or a window manager.](gui/index.md)<br>
  Important if you plan on using this system as a daily driver.
* [Set up SSH access.](ssh.md)<br>
  Recommended for headless servers.
