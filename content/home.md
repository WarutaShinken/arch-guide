# Arch Linux Guide

This is a guide to installing and configuring Arch Linux. It aims to be a more beginner-friendly version of the one on the official Arch Linux wiki, which it's based on and can be found [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org).

If you want a more out-of-the-box experience with Arch Linux, complete with a desktop environment, I recommend you check out [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com) instead.

Be aware that a lot of pages are currently undone.

The guide should be followed in this order:
* [Installation](install/index.md)
  * [Examples](install/examples/index.md)
* [Post-Installation Configuration](configure/index.md)
  * [Creating Users](configure/users.md)
  * [Choosing a GUI Environment](configure/users.md)
  * [SSH](configure/ssh.md)
